##Flexbox Layout##

The Flexbox Layout module provides a more efficient way to style items in a container even when their size is unknown or dynamic. The flex layout gives containers the ability to alter the height, width, and order and to best fill the available space of the items within it. It also expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. It can handle layouts in any direction, whether horizontal or vertical. That being said, they work well for pages but donâ€™t have the flexibility to support large or complex applications.
