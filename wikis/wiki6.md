##Intro to Node.js##

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O framework that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. 

In simpler terms, Node.js is a program you can use to execute JavaScript on your computers. Basically a JavaScript runtime.

You can check to see if Node is installed on your computer by opening the terminal and typing node -v

If it is installed, your terminal should return the version number. 

Node is an important tool to be familiar with if you want to develop apps with any modern JavaScript framework because things like React or Angular depend on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

Node also allows us to run JavaScript on the server. Its execution model causes servers very little overhead and therefore is capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

Node is particularly suited for building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration.

Node also speaks JSON, which is one of the most important data exchange formats on the web.
