##EJS##

EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

It allows the use of simple JS, makes for fast development times, has simple syntax, has speedy execution, is easy to debug, and has active development.

You typically use EJS to include repeatable parts of a site or app (partials) and pass data to the views.

The syntax to use an EJS partial is: <% include FILENAME %>

 The path to the partial is relative to the current file.
