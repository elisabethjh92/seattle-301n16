##jQuery##

jQuery is a JavaScript file that one can add to their web pages that lets them find elements using CSS-style selectors and do something with the elements using the JQuery method. 

It has many methods that one can use to work with the elements that one selects. The methods represent tasks that are often needed to perform with elements.

jQuery can return matched sets or jQuery selections. Some jQuery methods can retrieve information from and update the content of elements, but they don't always apply to all elements.

When one creates selections with jQuery, it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree rather than create copies of the nodes. 

A jQuery object stores references to elements and caching a jQuery object stores a reference to it in a variable. 

In plain JavaScript, one would need to create a loop to do the same thing to several elements. With jQuery, one can update all of the elements using one method when a selector returns multiple elements.

With jQuery, you can also go through a process called chaining, which is placing several methods in the same selector. 

jQuery's .ready()method checks that the page is ready for one's code to work with. 

One can use the .html() and the .text() methods to retreive and update the content of elements.

One can also update content of elements using the following four methods: .html() .text() .replaceWith() and .remove()

One can also insert new elements. First, one would need to create the new elements in a jQuery object. Next, one would need to use a method to insert the content into the page. The four following methods will allow one to add content to the DOM tree: .before() .after() .prepend() .append()

One can create attributes or access and update the contents of said attributes using the following four methods: .attr() .removeAttr() .addClass() and .removeClass

The .css() method allows one to retreive and set the values of CSS properties.

jQuery allows one to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements using the .each() method.

The .on() method is used to handle all events.
